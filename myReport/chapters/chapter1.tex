\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Background}

In the act of complaining, dissatisfaction or annoyance is expressed by a person or entity in response to a previous or ongoing event that has negatively impacted them \cite{olshtain_speechact_1987}. It provides an avenue to direct dissatisfaction to the appropriate organisation or individual with the hope of rectification or redressal. The event or action could be concerning a product or service procured by the concerned person or entity. For an organisation, the need to recognise, acknowledge and act on complaints is of significant importance to businesses and organisations to retain their customers while maintaining their reputations.

Until the advent of online platforms and specifically social media, the impact of negative word-of-mouth was confined to a relatively limited audience. However, since then complaints posted online now have the potential to rapidly go viral, reaching millions of individuals and significantly damaging a company's brand reputation and accumulated good-will in a short period \cite{tripp_when_2011}. Customers are able to express their complaints directly, conveniently, and with enhanced effectiveness to organisations through  multiple social media channels and platforms \cite{balaji_customer_2015}.
