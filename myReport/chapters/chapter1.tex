\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Background}
In the act of complaining, dissatisfaction or annoyance is expressed by a person or entity in response to a previous or ongoing event that has negatively impacted them \cite{olshtain_speechact_1987}. It provides an avenue to direct dissatisfaction to the appropriate organisation or individual with the hope of rectification or redressal. The event or action could be concerning a product or service procured by the concerned person or entity. The need to recognise, acknowledge and act on complaints is of significant importance to businesses and organisations to retain their customers while maintaining their reputations.
\newline \newline
Until the advent of online platforms and specifically social media, the impact of negative word-of-mouth was confined to a relatively limited audience. However, since then complaints posted online have the potential to rapidly go viral, reaching millions of individuals and significantly damaging a company's brand reputation and goodwill in a short period \cite{tripp_when_2011}. Customers are able to express their complaints directly, conveniently, and with enhanced effectiveness to organisations through multiple social media channels and platforms \cite{balaji_customer_2015}.
\newline \newline
In addition to the timely addressing of customer complaints, automated detection of complaints in natural language has a number of other purposes. Linguists could gain a more detailed understanding of the context, intent, and various types of complaints on a larger scale while psychologists could utilise this information to identify the underlying human traits that drive the behaviour and expression of complaints. Developing downstream natural language processing (NLP) applications, such as dialogue systems is another use case of this task \cite{preotiuc-pietro_automatically_2019}.
\newline \newline
Attempting to identify complaints manually through the multitude of posts and streams coming through the various social media channels is neither practical nor scalable. Various approaches to automate this task have been explored. The traditional vector-space method utilizing dictionaries has been applied in other text classification tasks \cite{liang_dictionary-based_2006}. Latent Semantic Indexing based on Singular Value Decomposition along with linguistic style features has been utilised to classify emails as complaints or not \cite{coussement_improving_2008}. In recent years, we have seen the use of various Machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) based approaches for similar classification problems. \cite{preotiuc-pietro_automatically_2019} have analysed the performance of logistic regression over various types of feature spaces against neural-network based models like Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). The use of more advanced approaches using transformer based models (BERT and its variants) have shown to have better results as explored by \cite{jin_complaint_2020}. As part of this paper, the use of BERT and its many variants will be explored further including that of lightweight variants that have been created in the recent past.
